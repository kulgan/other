It has widely been considered the initiating event in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, despite its ability to initiate disease in mice, its status as an initiating mutation is in dispute. In what is commonly used as the poster-child for targeted therapeutics, the development and use of imatinib in the clinic has led to profound improvements in the prognosis of the disease. However, imatinib resistance is still seen in patients with mutations in the ABL kinase domain of the fusion, most notably the T315I variant. In patients resistant to imatinib, either acquired or otherwise, second generation BCR-ABL TKI's (dasatinib and nilotinib) have seen some success in delivering a tumor response. Third generation ABL1 inhibitor ponatinib is the only FDA approved drug with activity against T315I . However due to risk of life-threatening blood clots and severe narrowing of blood vessels ponatinib is ONLY approved for T315I-positive CML or T315I-positive Ph+ ALL or in cases of CML, Ph+ ALL with resistance or intolerance to other approved ABL1 inhibitors.","gene_id":4,"type":"variant","variant_types":[{"id":120,"name":"transcript_fusion","display_name":"Transcript Fusion","so_id":"SO:0001886","description":"A feature fusion where the deletion brings together transcript regions.","url":"http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001886"}],"civic_actionability_score":238.0,"coordinates":{"chromosome":"22","start":23522397,"stop":23632600,"reference_bases":null,"variant_bases":null,"representative_transcript":"ENST00000305877.8","chromosome2":"9","start2":133729451,"stop2":133763063,"representative_transcript2":"ENST00000318560.5","ensembl_version":75,"reference_build":"GRCh37"}},{"id":2,"entrez_name":"ABL1","entrez_id":25,"name":"BCR-ABL T315I","description":"While the efficacy of imatinib has revolutionized chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) treatment, it is still not a cure-all.

MUTATION","description":"TERT promoter mutations are activating and commonly found at two hotspots within the TERT promoter region which occur 124 and 146 base pairs (hg19) upstream of the translation start site. These hotspots, termed C228T and C250T are observed in many cancer types and have a particularly high prevalence in glioblastoma (83%), melanoma (71%), bladder cancer (66%) and hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC) (47%). The two mutations are usually heterozygous and mutually exclusive and result in an increased similarity to an ETS binding domain and may act as a binding site to an ETS transcription factor. These mutations are thought to be early events in tumorgenesis and aid in cellular immortality. Decreased overall survival in patients with these mutations have been observed in medulloblastoma, thyroid cancer, urogenital cancer, melanoma, and laryngeal tumors. The presence of these mutations has also been shown to be predictive of malignant/premalignant nodules in HCC and meningiomas.","gene_id":79,"type":"variant","variant_types":[{"id":32,"name":"regulatory_region_variant","display_name":"Regulatory Region Variant","so_id":"SO:0001566","description":"A sequence

(ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered. Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.","gene_id":20,"type":"variant","variant_types":[{"id":123,"name":"transcript_amplification","display_name":"Transcript Amplification","so_id":"SO:0001889","description":"A feature amplification of a region containing a transcript.","url":"http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001889"}],"civic_actionability_score":822.5,"coordinates":{"chromosome":"17","start":37856333,"stop":37884915,"reference_bases":null,"variant_bases":null,"representative_transcript":"ENST00000269571.5","chromosome2":null,"start2":null,"stop2":null,"representative_transcript2":null,"ensembl_version":75,"reference_build":"GRCh37"}},{"id":307,"entrez_name":"ALK","entrez_id":238,"name":"EML4-ALK L1152R","description":"","gene_id":1,"type":"variant","variant_types":[{"id":47,"name":"missense_variant","display_name":"Missense Variant","so_id":"SO:0001583","description":"A sequence variant, that changes one or more bases, resulting in a different amino acid sequence but where the length is preserved.","url":"http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001583"},{"id":120,"name":"transcript_fusion","display_name":"Transcript Fusion","so_id":"SO:0001886","description":"A feature fusion where the deletion brings together transcript regions.","url":"http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001886"}],"civic_actionability_score":10.0,"coordinates":{"chromosome":"2","start":29445270,"stop":29445270,"reference_bases":"A","variant_bases":"C","representative_transcript":"ENST00000389048.3","chromosome2":null,"start2":null,"stop2":null,"representative_transcript2":null,"ensembl_version":75,"reference_build":"GRCh37"}},{"id":308,"entrez_name":"ALK","entrez_id":238,"name":"EML4-ALK G1269A","description":"The EML4-ALK G1269A mutation has been identified in non-small cell lung cancer patients resistant to crizotinib.

These are analogous to the exon 20 alterations found in EGFR TK domain. The M774 insertion, M774insAYVM, represents 62.5% of all HER2 kinase domain mutations identified (when combined with the A775insYVMA mutations as they translate to the identical amino acid sequence changes). As demonstrated in mouse models (Perrera et al., PNAS 2009) and subsequent clinical trials in human lung adenocarcinoma with these insertions, HER2 YVMA mutants predict response to several targeted HER2 agonists such as afatinib, trastuzumab, neratinib and TDM-1 (trastuzumab emtansine) as monotherapy or combined with specific chemotherapies.","gene_id":20,"type":"variant","variant_types":[{"id":106,"name":"inframe_insertion","display_name":"Inframe Insertion","so_id":"SO:0001821","description":"An inframe non synonymous variant that inserts bases into in the coding sequence.","url":"http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001821"}],"civic_actionability_score":36.0,"coordinates":{"chromosome":"17","start":37880996,"stop":37880997,"reference_bases":null,"variant_bases":"TACGTGATGGCT","representative_transcript":"ENST00000269571.5","chromosome2":null,"start2":null,"stop2":null,"representative_transcript2":null,"ensembl_version":75,"reference_build":"GRCh37"}},{"id":415,"entrez_name":"EGFR","entrez_id":1956,"name":"C797S","description":"","gene_id":19,"type":"variant","variant_types":[{"id":47,"name":"missense_variant","display_name":"Missense Variant","so_id":"SO:0001583","description":"A sequence variant, that changes one or more bases, resulting in a different amino acid sequence but where the length is preserved.","url":"http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001583"}],"civic_actionability_score":17.5,"coordinates":{"chromosome":"7","start":55249091,"stop":55249091,"reference_bases":"T","variant_bases":"A","representative_transcript":"ENST00000275493.2","chromosome2":null,"start2":null,"stop2":null,"representative_transcript2":null,"ensembl_version":75,"reference_build":"GRCh37"}},{"id":416,"entrez_name":"ERBB2","entrez_id":2064,"name":"SERUM LEVELS","description":"","gene_id":20,"type":"variant","variant_types":[{"id":183,"name":"N/A","display_name":"N/A","so_id":"N/A","description":"No suitable Sequence Ontology term exists.","url":"http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/N/A"}],"civic_actionability_score":35.0,"coordinates":{"chromosome":"17","start":37856333,"stop":37884915,"reference_bases":null,"variant_bases":null,"representative_transcript":"ENST00000269571.5","chromosome2":null,"start2":null,"stop2":null,"representative_transcript2":null,"ensembl_version":75,"reference_build":"GRCh37"}},{"id":417,"entrez_name":"THBS2","entrez_id":7058,"name":"UNDEREXPRESSION","description":"","gene_id":5761,"type":"variant","variant_types":[{"id":183,"name":"N/A","display_name":"N/A","so_id":"N/A","description":"No suitable Sequence Ontology term exists.","url":"http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/N/A"}],"civic_actionability_score":15.0,"coordinates":{"chromosome":"6","start":169615875,"stop":169654139,"reference_bases":null,"variant_bases":null,"representative_transcript":"ENST00000366787.3","chromosome2":null,"start2":null,"stop2":null,"representative_transcript2":null,"ensembl_version":75,"reference_build":"GRCh37"}},{"id":419,"entrez_name":"NTRK1","entrez_id":4914,"name":"NTRK1 FUSIONS","description":"","gene_id":3983,"type":"variant","variant_types":[{"id":120,"name":"transcript_fusion","display_name":"Transcript Fusion","so_id":"SO:0001886","description":"A feature fusion where the deletion brings together transcript regions.","url":"http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001886"}],"civic_actionability_score":72.5,"coordinates":{"chromosome":"1","start":156844175,"stop":156851434,"reference_bases":null,"variant_bases":null,"representative_transcript":"ENST00000524377.1","chromosome2":null,"start2":null,"stop2":null,"representative_transcript2":null,"ensembl_version":75,"reference_build":"GRCh37"}},{"id":420,"entrez_name":"IDH1","entrez_id":3417,"name":"R132H","description":"IDH1 R132 mutations have been observed in a number of cancer types, and appear to behave quite differently in different environments.

ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. \n\nIn a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. \n\nDue to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets.  ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.   \n\nALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC.  Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.","gene_id":1,"type":"variant","variant_types":[{"id":120,"name":"transcript_fusion","display_name":"Transcript Fusion","so_id":"SO:0001886","description":"A feature fusion where the deletion brings together transcript regions.","url":"http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001886"}],"civic_actionability_score":470.5,"coordinates":{"chromosome":"2","start":29415640,"stop":29446394,"reference_bases":null,"variant_bases":null,"representative_transcript":"ENST00000389048.3","chromosome2":null,"start2":null,"stop2":null,"representative_transcript2":null,"ensembl_version":75,"reference_build":"GRCh37"}},{"id":500,"entrez_name":"ALK","entrez_id":238,"name":"EML4-ALK E20;A20","description":"EML4-ALK variant 2 consists of a fusion of the ALK kinase domain (exons 20-29) with EML4 exons 1-20.

In cells the 3a variant was reported to be more stable than other variants, less sensitive to crizotinib and not to respond to Hsp90 inhibition.","gene_id":1,"type":"variant","variant_types":[{"id":120,"name":"transcript_fusion","display_name":"Transcript Fusion","so_id":"SO:0001886","description":"A feature fusion where the deletion brings together transcript regions.","url":"http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001886"}],"civic_actionability_score":25.0,"coordinates":{"chromosome":"2","start":42396490,"stop":42491871,"reference_bases":null,"variant_bases":null,"representative_transcript":"ENST00000318522.5","chromosome2":"2","start2":29415640,"stop2":29446394,"representative_transcript2":"ENST00000389048.3","ensembl_version":75,"reference_build":"GRCh37"}},{"id":504,"entrez_name":"TP53","entrez_id":7157,"name":"P47S","description":"","gene_id":45,"type":"variant","variant_types":[{"id":47,"name":"missense_variant","display_name":"Missense Variant","so_id":"SO:0001583","description":"A sequence variant, that changes one or more bases, resulting in a different amino acid sequence but where the length is preserved.","url":"http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001583"}],"civic_actionability_score":0.5,"coordinates":{"chromosome":"17","start":7579548,"stop":7579548,"reference_bases":"G","variant_bases":"A","representative_transcript":"ENST00000269305.4","chromosome2":null,"start2":null,"stop2":null,"representative_transcript2":null,"ensembl_version":75,"reference_build":"GRCh37"}},{"id":505,"entrez_name":"GNAQ","entrez_id":2776,"name":"MUTATION","description":"","gene_id":2317,"type":"variant","variant_types":[],"civic_actionability_score":26.0,"coordinates":{"chromosome":"9","start":80331003,"stop":80646374,"reference_bases":null,"variant_bases":null,"representative_transcript":"ENST00000286548.4","chromosome2":null,"start2":null,"stop2":null,"representative_transcript2":null,"ensembl_version":75,"reference_build":"GRCh37"}},{"id":506,"entrez_name":"GNA11","entrez_id":2767,"name":"MUTATION","description":"","gene_id":2308,"type":"variant","variant_types":[],"civic_actionability_score":24.0,"coordinates":{"chromosome":"19","start":3094408,"stop":3124002,"reference_bases":null,"variant_bases":null,"representative_transcript":"ENST00000078429.4","chromosome2":null,"start2":null,"stop2":null,"representative_transcript2":null,"ensembl_version":75,"reference_build":"GRCh37"}},{"id":507,"entrez_name":"GNAQ","entrez_id":2776,"name":"Q209","description":"","gene_id":2317,"type":"variant","variant_types":[{"id":103,"name":"protein_altering_variant","display_name":"Protein Altering Variant","so_id":"SO:0001818","description":"A sequence_variant which is predicted to change the protein encoded in the coding sequence.","url":"http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001818"}],"civic_actionability_score":20.0,"coordinates":{"chromosome":"9","start":80409487,"stop":80409489,"reference_bases":null,"variant_bases":null,"representative_transcript":"ENST00000286548.4","chromosome2":null,"start2":null,"stop2":null,"representative_transcript2":null,"ensembl_version":75,"reference_build":"GRCh37"}},{"id":508,"entrez_name":"PMS2","entrez_id":5395,"name":"K706FS*19","description":"","gene_id":4371,"type":"variant","variant_types":[{"id":54,"name":"minus_1_frameshift_variant","display_name":"Minus 1 Frameshift Variant","so_id":"SO:0001592","description":"A sequence variant which causes a disruption of the translational reading frame, by shifting one base ahead.","url":"http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001592"}],"civic_actionability_score":10.0,"coordinates":{"chromosome":"7","start":6022512,"stop":6022512,"reference_bases":null,"variant_bases":"","representative_transcript":"ENST00000265849.7","chromosome2":null,"start2":null,"stop2":null,"representative_transcript2":null,"ensembl_version":75,"reference_build":"GRCh37"}},{"id":509,"entrez_name":"KIT","entrez_id":3815,"name":"EXON 9 MUTATION","description":"In patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), imatinib has improved outcomes for patients with KIT mutations.

The E70K missense mutation, located in the Beta-domain of VHL, is rare in open-source genome databases (0.00001489 allele frequency in ExAC, 4.365e-6 allele frequency in gnomAD) and was identified in several individuals with VHL disease symptoms (see evidence statements). Thus, this variant could be assigned ACMG code 'PP2' - Missense mutation in a gene with a low rate of benign missense variation where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease. Although this variant is registered once in ExAC and gnomAD, 'PM2' could be applied (Absent from controls in ESP, 1000 Genomes or ExAc) because VHL manifestations sometimes emerge later in adulthood.
