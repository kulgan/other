1	ABL1	25	BCR-ABL	The BCR-ABL fusion protein, commonly referred to as the Philadelphia chromosome, is one of the most studied fusion genes in cancer. It has widely been considered the initiating event in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, despite its ability to initiate disease in mice, its status as an initiating mutation is in dispute. In what is commonly used as the poster-child for targeted therapeutics, the development and use of imatinib in the clinic has led to profound improvements in the prognosis of the disease. However, imatinib resistance is still seen in patients with mutations in the ABL kinase domain of the fusion, most notably the T315I variant. In patients resistant to imatinib, either acquired or otherwise, second generation BCR-ABL TKI's (dasatinib and nilotinib) have seen some success in delivering a tumor response. Third generation ABL1 inhibitor ponatinib is the only FDA approved drug with activity against T315I . However due to risk of life-threatening blood clots and severe narrowing of blood vessels ponatinib is ONLY approved for T315I-positive CML or T315I-positive Ph+ ALL or in cases of CML, Ph+ ALL with resistance or intolerance to other approved ABL1 inhibitors.	4	variant	238	transcript_fusion		ENST00000305877.8	ENST00000318560.5	1
2	ABL1	25	BCR-ABL T315I	While the efficacy of imatinib has revolutionized chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) treatment, it is still not a cure-all. Both initial resistance and acquired resistance as a result of selection have been seen in a small subset of CML patients. The ABL kinase domain mutation T315I (aka T334I) has been shown to be one such mutation that confers resistance to imatinib. Second generation TKI's (dasatinib and ponatinib) specific to BCR-ABL have shown efficacy in treating resistant cases.	4	variant	90	missense_variant	transcript_fusion	ENST00000318560.5		2
3	ABL1	25	BCR-ABL E255K	While the efficacy of imatinib has revolutionized chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) treatment, it is still not a cure-all. Both initial resistance and acquired resistance as a result of selection have been seen in a small subset of CML patients. The ABL kinase domain mutation E255K has been shown to be one such mutation that confers resistance to imatinib. Second generation TKI's (dasatinib and nilotinib) specific to BCR-ABL have shown efficacy in treating resistant cases.	4	variant	48.5	missense_variant	transcript_fusion	ENST00000318560.5		3
4	AKT1	207	E17K	AKT1 E17K is a recurrent mutation that has been observed in breast, colorectal, lung, and ovarian cancer. It has been convincingly shown to be an activating mutation resulting in PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activity. It has been suggested that this mutation decreases the cell's sensitivity to AKT1 allosteric kinase inhibitors. This, and other AKT1 mutations, are the subject of much research and development for therapeutics.	2	variant	32.5	missense_variant		ENST00000407796.2		4
5	ALK	238	EML4-ALK	The EML4-ALK fusion variant 1 consisting of ALK kinase domain (exons 20-29) fused to EML4 exons 1-13 is the most common EML4-ALK variant, and was discovered in non-small cell lung cancer. Multiple EML4 breakpoint shave been described with differential sensitivity to inhibitors with variant 1 showing greater sensitivity than 3a in cell lines. EML4-ALK is crizotinib sensitive; however, several mutations that confer resistance mutations have been described in case studies. In the only clinical trial for crizotinib that included determination of EML4-ALK variant type in a subset of its participants, a very high response rate was observed, although the numbers were insufficient to validate correlation of variant type to outcome. Preclinical studies with this variant have indicated sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibitors.	1	variant	48	transcript_fusion		ENST00000318522.5	ENST00000389048.3	5
6	ALK	238	EML4-ALK C1156Y	In patients with non-small cell lung cancer exhibiting EML4-ALK fusion, C1156Y has been shown to confer resistance to crizotinib. Case reports indicate that secondary mutations can modulate drug sensitivity. EML4-ALK C1156Y/L1196M maintained crizotinib resistance while the lorlatinib resistant combination EML4-ALK C1156Y/L1198F re-sensitized the tumor to crizotinib treatment.	1	variant	19	missense_variant	transcript_fusion	ENST00000389048.3		6
7	ALK	238	EML4-ALK L1196M	In patients with non-small cell lung cancer exhibiting EML4-ALK fusion, L1196M has been shown to confer resistance to crizotinib. This was also true in a patient with both EML4-ALK C1156Y & L1196M.	1	variant	31	missense_variant	transcript_fusion	ENST00000389048.3		7
8	ALK	238	F1174L	ALK F1174L has been observed as recurrent in neuroblastoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and other cancer types. Neuroblastoma cells containing this mutation have shown resistance to low doses of criztonib. However, increased dosage can overcome this resistance in cell lines studies. TAE684 has also proven effective in both NSCLC and neuroblastoma F1174L containing cells.	1	variant	33.5	missense_variant		ENST00000389048.3		8
9	ALK	238	R1275Q	ALK R1275Q has been observed as a recurrent mutation in  neuroblastoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as well as other cancer types. Neuroblastoma cells with this mutation have shown sensitivity to the ALK-inhibitor TAE684. This and the geldanamycin deriviative 17-DMAG have been shown to be effective in NSCLC cell lines.	1	variant	23	missense_variant		ENST00000389048.3		9
10	ARAF	369	S214C	ARAF S214C has been found to be a recurrent oncogenic mutation in non-small cell lung cancer. It has been shown to confer sensitivity to sorafenib and trametenib in cell lines. In a case study of advanced stage lung adenocarcinoma harboring this mutation, sorafenib also acheived near-complete clinical remission. This case has brought more interest to the variant from a research and clinical perspective.	3	variant	11	missense_variant		ENST00000377045.4		10
11	BRAF	673	V600D	Patients harboring mutations in valine 600 residue of BRAF have been shown to be sensitive to dabrafenib. For more information on the V600 locus, see the V600E entry.	5	variant	25	missense_variant		ENST00000288602.6		11
12	BRAF	673	V600E	BRAF V600E has been shown to be recurrent in many cancer types. It is one of the most widely studied variants in cancer. This variant is correlated with poor prognosis in certain cancer types, including colorectal cancer and papillary thyroid cancer. The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations. However, cetuximab and panitumumab have been largely shown to be ineffective without supplementary treatment.	5	variant	939	missense_variant		ENST00000288602.6		12
13	BRAF	673	V600E+V600M	A case study of a single patient harboring both a V600E and a V600M mutation, dabrafenib was shown to acheive clinical response.	5	variant	7.5	missense_variant		ENST00000288602.6		13
14	BRAF	673	V600E AMPLIFICATION	Amplification of BRAF V600E has been shown to confer resistance to MEK inhibitors. For more information on the V600 locus, see the V600E entry.	5	variant	1	missense_variant	transcript_amplification	ENST00000288602.6		14
17	BRAF	673	V600	BRAF mutations of the valine 600 residue have been shown to be recurrent in many cancer types. Of the V600 mutations, V600E is the most widely researched. V600 mutations as a whole have been correlated to poorer prognosis in colorectal and papilarry thyroid cancers. V600 mutations have also been shown to confer sensitivity to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib.

18	CCND1	595	AMPLIFICATION	CCND1 amplification has been implicated in poorer prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer.	8	variant	47	transcript_amplification		ENST00000227507.2		16
19	CCND1	595	EXPRESSION	CCND1 expression, and its prognositc impact, is still in dispute. Three experiments in non-small cell lung cancer have shown it to have no impact on survival, but three additional studies have shown it results in poorer prognosis. There is also some ambiguity in how the boundaries between expression and overexpression are defined.	8	variant	30			ENST00000227507.2		17
20	CCND1	595	OVEREXPRESSION	Cyclin D has been shown in many cancer types to be misregulated. Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are misregulated are widely variable, and range from genomic amplification to promoter methylation changes. While Cyclin D2 has only been found to be significantly misregulated in glioma, Cyclin D1 in particular seems to be a pan-cancer actor. Cyclin D misregulation has been shown to lead to poorer outcomes in a number of studies, and currently there are no FDA-approved targeted therapies.	8	variant	106			ENST00000227507.2		18
21	CCND2	894	OVEREXPRESSION	Cyclin D has been shown in many cancer types to be misregulated. Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are misregulated are widely variable, and range from genomic amplification to promoter methylation changes. While Cyclin D2 has only been found to be significantly misregulated in glioma, Cyclin D1 in particular seems to be a pan-cancer actor. Cyclin D misregulation has been shown to lead to poorer outcomes in a number of studies, and currently there are no FDA-approved targeted therapies.	9	variant	16			ENST00000261254.3		19
22	CCND2	894	PROMOTER DEMETHYLATION	Cyclin D has been shown in many cancer types to be misregulated. Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are misregulated are widely variable, and range from genomic amplification to promoter methylation changes. While Cyclin D2 has only been found to be significantly misregulated in glioma, Cyclin D1 in particular seems to be a pan-cancer actor. Cyclin D misregulation has been shown to lead to poorer outcomes in a number of studies, and currently there are no FDA-approved targeted therapies.	9	variant	3			ENST00000261254.3		20
23	CCND3	896	LOSS	Cyclin D has been shown in many cancer types to be misregulated. Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are deregulated are widely variable, and range from genomic amplification to promoter methylation changes. Cyclin D3 loss has been reported in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a seemingly unique trend when compared to the amplifcations and overexpressions of the other cyclin D's. Treating cyclin D3 knockout mice with the targeted therapeutic palbociclib significantly increased the median survival of a Notch-driven model of T-ALL.	10	variant	3	loss_of_function_variant		ENST00000372991.4		21
24	CCNE1	898	OVEREXPRESSION	Cyclin E, while currenly not as widely implicated as its counterpart, cyclin D, has been implicated in various carcinomas, including breast, gastric, stomach and colorectal. High levels of cyclin E, either by gene amplification or overexpression, are correlated with later stage disease and have been shown to lead to poorer prognosis in gastic carcinoma. It has also been shown, in lung cancer specifically, that neoplastic cells with higher levels of the cyclin E/CDK2 complex are more radiosensitive than their lowly expressed counterparts.	11	variant	62			ENST00000262643.3		22
25	CDK4	1019	EXPRESSION	CDK4, along with its partner CDK6, are key players in cell cycle progression. The complex has been implicated in a number of cancer types, and is the focus of therapeutic research and development. One targeted therapy for CDK inhibition is palbociclib, which may slow the growth of advanced stage breast cancers. It has also been shown, in mouse, that CDK inhibition may sensitize mutant PIK3CA tumors to PI3K inhibitors.	13	variant	8			ENST00000257904.6		23
27	CDKN2A	1029	PROMOTER HYPERMETHYLATION	CDKN2A loss has been shown to be a significant event in a number of cancer types. One mechanism by which this can occur is by hypermethylation of the CDKN2A promoter region. While no targeted therapeutic has been engaged in clinical trials, the prognostic impact has been studied by a number of meta-analyses. The prognostic impact of promoter hypermethylation has been relatively ambiguous. Many studies have shown significant p-values suggesting poorer prognostic outcomes for patients with hypermethylation in colorectal, liver, and younger lung cancer patients. This being said, there is still research to be done before this becomes a widely-accepted prognostic indicator.	14	variant	15			ENST00000498124.1		24
28	CEBPA	1050	N-TERMINAL FRAME SHIFT	CEBPA N-terminal frame shift mutations that result in a premature stop codon are associated with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML). CEBPA mutations are associated with a favorable prognosis; however, NPM1 and FLT3 mutations should also be assessed in CN-AML patients as concurrent mutations may have prognostic implications. N-terminal frame shift mutations within amino acids 1-120 have been shown to disrupt expression of the full-length 42kDa isoform while maintaining expression of a 30kDa isoform (translated from the AUG at full-length protein isoform amino acid M120). This 30kDa isoform exhibits dominant negative activity.	15	variant	3	frameshift_truncation	dominant_negative_variant	ENST00000498907.2		25
29	CEBPA	1050	MUTATION	CEBPA mutations are associated with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) and a favorable prognosis. However, NPM1 and FLT3 mutations should also be assessed in CN-AML patients as concurrent mutations may have prognostic implications.	15	variant	105	transcript_variant	loss_of_function_variant	ENST00000498907.2		26
30	CSF1R	1436	MEF2D-CSF1R	MEF2D-CSF1R is a fusion that has been observed in acute lymphocytic leukemia. In cell lines harboring this event, treatment with imatinib has shown notable sensitivity.	33	variant	3	transcript_fusion		ENST00000348159.4	ENST00000286301.3	27
31	PRKACA	5566	DNAJB1-PRKACA	This fusion has been found to be very recurrent in the rare form of adolescent liver cancer, fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma. In one study, this fusion was observed in 15/15 FL-HCC cases examined and functional studies found that the fusion retained kinase activity. The presence of this fusion may be used as a diagnostic marker for this rare tumor type.	17	variant	75	transcript_fusion		ENST00000254322.2	ENST00000308677.4	28
32	DNMT3A	1788	R882	DNMT3A R882 mutations are associated with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) with R882H as the most common form. Mutations in DNMT3A have largely been associated with poorer prognosis, however this is not consistent across all studies. This may be a result of patient age or combining R882 and non-R882 mutations during analysis as studies have indicated independent mechanisms of action and differential prognostic implications for these mutation types. One study that independently analyzed R882 and non-R882 mutations showed R882 mutations were associated with poorer prognosis than patients with wildtype and non-R882 mutations, but only in older patients with AML.	18	variant	525	missense_variant		ENST00000264709.3		29
33	EGFR	1956	L858R	EGFR L858R has long been recognized as a functionally significant mutation in cancer, and is one of the most prevalent single mutations in lung cancer. Best described in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the mutation seems to confer sensitivity to first and second generation TKI's like gefitinib and neratinib. NSCLC patients with this mutation treated with TKI's show increased overall and progression-free survival, as compared to chemotherapy alone. Third generation TKI's are currently in clinical trials that specifically focus on mutant forms of EGFR, a few of which have shown efficacy in treating patients that failed to respond to earlier generation TKI therapies.	19	variant	326.5	missense_variant		ENST00000275493.2		30
34	EGFR	1956	T790M	EGFR T790M was one of the very first mutations recognized to confer resistance to targeted therapies in non-small cell lung cancer. While successful in amplified EGFR, the efficacy of the first and second generation TKI's (erlotinib, gefitinib, neratinib) in treating patients harboring this mutation before treatment is notably lower. This lack of efficacy can likely be to blame for the poorer prognosis for patients with this mutation as compared to patients with wildtype EGFR or other types of EGFR mutations. Approximately half of EGFR mutant tumors with acquired resistance to TKI inhibition have been shown to harbor this mutation, implicating it as a mechanism of acquired therapy resistence. A third generation TKI (osimertinib) has been approved for the treatment of EGFR T790M mutant NSCLC. Patients positive for T790M in a plasma-based test have similar outcomes like those with tumor biopsy testing.	19	variant	376.25	missense_variant		ENST00000275493.2		31
35	ERBB2	2064	D769H	ERBB2 D769H was one of the first ERBB2 variants to be functionally classified (Bose et al. 2013). This mutation was shown to be an activating mutation in an in vitro assay. In the same paper, this mutation (along with other ERBB2 activating mutations) in MCF10A breast cancer cell lines were shown to be sensitive to the kinase inhibitor neratinib. More recent evidence may show that HER2 activating mutations confer sensitivity to a host of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which is the topic of current clinical trials and research.	20	variant	4	missense_variant		ENST00000269571.5		32
36	ERBB2	2064	D769Y	ERBB2 D769Y was one of the first ERBB2 variants to be functionally classified (Bose et al., 2013). This mutation was shown to be an activating mutation in an in vitro assay. In the same paper, this mutation (along with other ERBB2 activating mutations) in MCF10A breast cancer cell lines have been shown to be sensitive to the kinase inhibitor neratinib. More recent evidence may show that HER2 acitivating mutations confer sensitivity to a host of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which is the topic of current clinical trials and research.	20	variant	4	missense_variant		ENST00000269571.5		33
37	ERBB2	2064	DEL 755-759	ERBB2 in-frame deletion of 755-759 was one of the first ERBB2 variants to be functionally classified (Bose et al. 2013). This mutation was shown to be an activating mutation in an in vitro assay. In the same paper, this mutation (along with other ERBB2 activating mutations) in MCF10A breast cancer cell lines have been shown to be sensitive to the kinase inhibitor neratinib.

39	ERBB2	2064	L755S	ERBB2 L755S was one of the first ERBB2 variants to be functionally classified (Bose et al. 2013). This mutation was not shown to be an activating mutation, unlike many of the other variants queried. This mutation was also shown to confer resistance to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib in MCF10A cell lines.	20	variant	14	missense_variant		ENST00000269571.5		36
40	ERBB2	2064	L755W	ERBB2 L755W was one of the first ERBB2 variants to be functionally classified (Bose et al., 2013). This mutation was shown to be an activating mutation in an in vitro assay.

42	ERBB2	2064	R678Q	ERBB2 R678Q was shown to have NO functional effect in tissue culture assay (Bose et al 2013). This conclusion was confirmed by a second, independent lab.	20	variant	5	missense_variant		ENST00000269571.5		39
43	ERBB2	2064	R896C	ERBB2 R896C was one of the first ERBB2 variants to be functionally classified (Bose et al. 2013). This mutation was shown to be an activating mutation in an in vitro assay.

46	ESR1	2099	L536Q	ESR1 biology has become a central focus in breast cancer therapy. In ER+ tumors, mutations in the ESR1 ligand binding domain have been shown to confer resistance to hormone therapy. This evidence has led to an increased use of targeted sequencing of the estrogen receptor in breast and ovarian cancer. Y536Q is one of these ligand binding domain mutations, and is commonly implicated in this hormone resistance. Preliminary data suggests ER-degrading agents, such as fulvestrant, may be beneficial in treating ESR1 mutant, hormone resistant breast cancers.	21	variant	8	missense_variant		ENST00000440973.1		43

52	FGFR2	2263	FGFR2-MGEA5	In a clinical sequencing program for advanced stage cancers, Wu et al (2013, Cancer Discovery) has idenified a number of FGFR fusions in patients with many different cancer types. These fusions were also found to retain oligomerization capability, and result in enhanced cell proliferation. Cell lines harboring these fusions were shown to respond to pazopanib. Additionally, tumor size reduction was achieved by both ponatinib and pazopanib treatments administered separately in a single patient with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and this fusion. The authors use these cases to highlight the need for enhanced clinical sequencing efforts.	22	variant	5	transcript_fusion		ENST00000457416.2	ENST00000361464.3	48

These fusions were also found to retain oligomerization capability, and result in enhanced cell proliferation. These fusions were shown to respond to pazopanib. The authors use these cases to highlight the need for enhanced clinical sequencing efforts.	23	variant	3	transcript_fusion		ENST00000340107.4	ENST00000005260.8	49
54	FGFR2	2263	FGFR2-TACC3	In a clinical sequencing program for advanced stage cancers, Wu et al has identified a number of FGFR fusions in patients with many different cancer types. These fusions were also found to retain oligomerization capability, and result in enhanced cell proliferation. These fusions were shown to respond to pazopanib.

55	FLT3	2322	ITD	FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplications) frequently occur in patients with hematologic malignancies such as chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome, but particularly in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). These duplication events disrupt the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and can be the result of a duplication of internal FLT3 sequence or other unrelated sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication event. The length of these duplications can vary widely which may have prognostic consequences, but this has not been conclusively determined. FLT3-ITD mutations overall have generally been associated with poor prognosis. Additional genes associated with CN-AML such as NPM1 may modulate the prognosis associated with this variant.	24	variant	432.5	inframe_insertion		ENST00000241453.7		51
56	FLT3	2322	TKD MUTATION	FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain mutations (FLT3-TKD) are much less common than FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplication) mutations and may not confer the same prognostic impact. Although the majority of mutations are point mutations effecting D835 (most frequently D835Y), a small proportion involve an in-frame deletion of I836. These mutations are within the activation loop of the second tyrosine kinase domain of FLT3 and thought to result in constitutive activation of the receptor.	24	variant	120	nonsynonymous_variant		ENST00000241453.7		52
57	GATA2	2624	EXPRESSION	GATA2 misregulation has been observed in a number of hematologic malignancies, as well as non-small cell lung cancer. Treatment of over-active GATA2 pathways using the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib has shown dramatic tumor regression in lung cancer.	25	variant	4			ENST00000341105.2		53
58	IDH1	3417	R132	IDH1 R132 mutations have been observed in a number of cancer types, and appear to behave quite differently in different environments. In myelodysplastic syndromes, IDH1 R132 mutations have been shown to be associated with worse outcome and shorter overall survival. They have also been linked to cytogenetically normal AML, an intermediate risk subtype of the disease. However, in glioblastoma and astrocytoma, patients with IDH1 mutations have shown better overall survival than patients with wild-type IDH1. Also in contrast to AML, in glioblastoma, IDH1 mutations have been associated with the specific cytogenetic abnormalities, 1p and 19q deletions.	26	variant	135	protein_altering_variant		ENST00000415913.1		54
59	IDH1	3417	R132C	IDH1 R132 mutations have been observed in a number of cancer types, and appear to behave quite differently in different environments. In myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IDH1 R132 mutations have been shown to be associated with worse outcome and shorter overall survival. They have also been linked to cytogenetically normal AML, an intermediate risk subtype of the disease. However, in glioblastoma and astrocytoma, patients with IDH1 mutations have shown better overall survival than patients with wild-type IDH1. Also in contrast to AML, in glioblastoma, IDH1 mutations have been associated with the specific cytogenetic abnormalities, 1p and 19q deletions.	26	variant	63	missense_variant		ENST00000415913.1		55
62	IDH2	3418	R140	IDH2 mutations have been observed in a number of hematologic malignancies. In acute myeloid leukemia, the R140 mutants show mixed results affecting overall survival as compared to their wild-type counterparts. In myelodysplastic syndromes, however, no prognostic link was discovered between IDH2 mutation status and overall survival.	27	variant	60	protein_altering_variant		ENST00000330062.3		56
63	IDH2	3418	R172K	IDH2 mutations have been observed in a number of hematologic malignancies. In acute myeloid leukemia, the R172K mutation has been linked with poorer prognosis and worse overall survival than IDH2 wild-type patients. However, in myelodisplastic syndromes, studies did not find a prognostic association between this variant and patient outcomes.	27	variant	35	missense_variant		ENST00000330062.3		57
64	JAK2	3717	V617F	JAK2 V617F is a highly recurrent mutation in myeloproliferative diseases. It is found in around 98% of patients with polycythemia vera, and just over half of the patients with essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis. While less associated with cancer, when it is seen, it is more likely to be in myeloid leukemias than lymphoid leukemias. The V617F mutation is an activating mutation, resulting in increased kinase activity. The mutation seems to be restricted to hematologic malignancies. Treatment of JAK mutant diseases with ruxolitinib has seen some clinical success.	28	variant	83	missense_variant	gain_of_function_variant	ENST00000381652.3		58
65	KIT	3815	D816V	KIT D816V is a mutation observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This variant has been linked to poorer prognosis and worse outcome in AML patients.	29	variant	60	missense_variant		ENST00000288135.5		59
66	KIT	3815	EXON 11 MUTATION	c-KIT mutations in exon 11 lie within the juxtamembrane domain, and are very recurrent in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, often bearing a poorer prognosis than other KIT mutations. Cells harboring exon 11 mutations have shown sensitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib, offering a better prognosis to patients treated with the drug in the first year. Small cohorts of melanoma patients harboring exon 11 KIT mutations have shown response to imatinib and sunitinib.	29	variant	107.5	coding_sequence_variant		ENST00000288135.5		60
67	KIT	3815	INTERNAL DUPLICATION	c-KIT internal duplications have been observed in exon 11, within the juxtamembrane domain. In a case study of an anal melanoma patient harboring this event, imatinib confered marked response. Also, cells harboring exon 11 mutations have shown sensitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib, offering a better prognosis to patients treated with the drug in the first year.	29	variant	7.5	inframe_insertion		ENST00000288135.5		61
69	KIT	3815	EXON 14 MUTATION	c-KIT exon 14 mutations lie within the tyrosine kinase domain of the protein. While relatively rare in primary gastrointestinal tumors, they are notably more prevalent in refractory disease, suggesting a role in imatinib resistance. Unlike mutations in other KIT exons, exon 14 mutations seem relatively rare in melanoma.	29	variant	15	exon_variant		ENST00000288135.5		62
72	KIT	3815	L576P	KIT L576P is an exon 11 mutation that lies within the juxtamembrane domain. It is one of the most recurrent KIT mutations in melanoma, and both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown sensitivity to imatinib.	29	variant	9	missense_variant		ENST00000288135.5		63
73	KIT	3815	V654A	KIT V654A is an exon 13 mutation that lies within the tyrosine kinase 1 domain of the protein. It has been shown to be an activating mutation by in vitro studies. This mutation is associated with imatinib resistance in melanoma patients. However, second generation TKI's such as sunitinib and midostaurin (PKC 412) have seen success in acheiving tumor response.	29	variant	18	missense_variant		ENST00000288135.5		64
75	KRAS	3845	EXON 2 MUTATION	Exon 2 mutations have been associated with reduced response rates or resistance to EGFR inhibitors in non-small cell lung and colorectal cancer. The NCCN guidelines for colorectal cancer contain recommendations that the targeted therapies cetuximab and panitumumab should only be used in the context of wild type KRAS.	30	variant	170	missense_variant		ENST00000256078.4		65
76	KRAS	3845	G12	While the KRAS G12 region is a widely studied recurrent region in cancer, its impact on clinical action is still debated. Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer, however this hypothesis is in need of further validation. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G13 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. However, cetuximab treatment was shown to extend survival in a cohort of colorectal patients.	30	variant	115	protein_altering_variant		ENST00000256078.4		66
77	KRAS	3845	G12/G13	While the KRAS G12 region is a widely studied recurrent region in cancer, its impact on clinical action is still debated. Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer, however this hypothesis is in need of further validation. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G13 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. However, cetuximab treatment was shown to extend survival in a cohort of colorectal patients.	30	variant	161	protein_altering_variant		ENST00000256078.4		67
78	KRAS	3845	G12C	While the KRAS G12 region is a widely studied recurrent region in cancer, its impact on clinical action is still debated. Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer, however this hypothesis is in need of further validation. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G13 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. However, cetuximab treatment was shown to extend survival in a cohort of colorectal patients.	30	variant	74	missense_variant		ENST00000256078.4		68
79	KRAS	3845	G12D	While the KRAS G12 region is a widely studied recurrent region in cancer, its impact on clinical action is still actively debated. Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer, however this hypothesis is in need of further validation. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G13 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. The NCCN guidelines for colorectal cancer contain recommendations that the targeted therapies cetuximab and panitumumab should only be used in the context of wild type KRAS. However, cetuximab treatment was shown to extend survival in a single cohort of colorectal patients with G12D mutations. Overall, the interpretation for KRAS mutations in most clinical scenarios is still undecided.	30	variant	125.5	missense_variant		ENST00000256078.4		69
80	KRAS	3845	G13	While the KRAS G13 region is a widely studied recurrent region in cancer, its impact on clinical action is still debated. Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer, however this hypothesis is in need of further validation. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G12 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib.

81	KRAS	3845	G13D	While the KRAS G13 region is a widely studied recurrent region in cancer, its impact on clinical action is still debated. Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G12 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. However, results are conflicting with retrospective analyses suggesting a better response to EGFR-Inhibition. A recent prospective phase-II study (12 patients, Schirripa et. al. 2015) could not reproduce this finding and another prospective phase II trial is currently ongoing.	30	variant	81	missense_variant		ENST00000256078.4		71
82	MAP2K1	5604	P124S	MAP2K1 P124S is a recurrent mutation in melanoma, and is seen in bladder and colon cancer to a lesser degree. The P124S mutation has been shown to contribute to AZD6244 resistance in melanoma cell lines, but considerably less so than its Q56P counterpart.	31	variant	3	missense_variant		ENST00000307102.5		72
83	MAP2K1	5604	Q56P	MAP2K1 Q56P is a recurrent mutation in melanoma and gastric cancer. This mutation has been shown to confer considerable resistance to AZD6244 treatment of melanoma cell lines.	31	variant	3	missense_variant		ENST00000307102.5		73
85	MGMT	4255	PROMOTER METHYLATION	MGMT promoter methylation has been observed to impact tumor progression in glioblastoma multiforme. In patients exhibiting promoter methylation, the akylating agent carmustine has shown efficacy. In patients lacking methylation, combining carmustine with the MGMT inhibitor O(6)-benzylguanine may be effective, but more experiments are required. Clinical trials have also shown selective sensitivity of promoter methylation-positive patients to temozolomide, making a case for wider methylation screening in GBM patients.	34	variant	136			ENST00000306010.7		74
86	NPM1	4869	EXON 12 MUTATION	NPM1 exon 12 mutations are frequently identified in patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and often co-occur with FLT3-ITD. FLT3 status should also be evaluated as co-occurence with FLT3-ITD may impact prognosis. Exon 12 mutations have been identified as a predictor of good prognostic outcomes in the absence of FLT3-ITD. Due to their high frequency, NPM1 mutations have been retrospectively analyzed in the context of a number of therapies including variable results following ATRA treatment as well as improved response to high-dose daunorubicin or valproic acid. Additionally, multiple groups have shown increased surface expression of CD33 associated with NPM1 mutation, suggesting these patients may respond to anti-CD33 therapy. Cytoplasmic sequestration of NPM1 (NPM1c) is associated with a good response to induction therapy.	35	variant	454	exon_variant		ENST00000517671.1		75
87	NPM1	4869	W288FS	NPM1 W288fs (aka NPM1-A) is located in exon 12 of NPM1 and is the most common NPM1 mutation identified in acute myeloid leukemia. This mutation results in cytoplasmic localization of NPM1 (NPM1c) which is associated with a good response to induction therapy. Although it is the most extensively studied NPM1 exon 12 mutation, it is generally grouped with other exon 12 mutations for patient analysis (see NPM1 Exon 12 variants for more information).	35	variant	43.75	frameshift_elongation		ENST00000517671.1		76

94	NRAS	4893	Q61	NRAS Q61 mutations have been found in multiple myeloma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, melanoma, and others. Two melanoma patients, each harboring mutations at this locus (Q61L and Q61R), responded to treatment with the akylating agent temozolomide. However, in colorectal cancer patients, mutations at this locus have been shown to confer resistance to cetuximab. The prognostic impact of mutations at this locus is currently under study.	36	variant	95	missense_variant		ENST00000369535.4		79

98	PDGFRA	5156	D842I	PDGFRA D842 mutations are characterized broadly as imatinib resistance mutations. This is most well characterized in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, but other cell lines containing these mutations have been shown to be resistant as well. In imatinib resistant cell lines, a number of other therapeutics have demonstrated efficacy. These include; crenolanib, sirolimus, and midostaurin (PKC412).	38	variant	4	missense_variant		ENST00000257290.5		82

This is most well characterized in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, but other cell lines containing these mutations have been shown to be resistant as well. Exogenous expression of the A842V mutation resulted in constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFRA in the absence of ligand in 293T cells and cytokine-independent proliferation of the IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cell line, both evidence that this is an activating mutation. In imatinib resistant cell lines, a number of other therapeutics have demonstrated efficacy. These include; crenolanib, sirolimus, and midostaurin (PKC412).	38	variant	84	missense_variant		ENST00000257290.5		83

This is most well characterized in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, but other cell lines containing these mutations have been shown to be resistant as well. In imatinib resistant cell lines, a number of other therapeutics have demonstrated efficacy. These include; crenolanib, sirolimus, and midostaurin (PKC412).	38	variant	4	missense_variant		ENST00000257290.5		86
103	PIK3CA	5290	E542K	PIK3CA E545K/E542K are the second most recurrent PIK3CA mutations in breast cancer, and are highly recurrent mutations in many other cancer types. E545K, and possibly the other mutations in the E545 region, may present patients with a poorer prognosis than patients with other PIK3CA variants or wild-type PIK3CA. There is also data to suggest that E545/542 mutations may confer resistance to EGFR inhibitors like cetuximab. While very prevalent, targeted therapies for variants in PIK3CA are still in early clinical trial phases.	37	variant	65.5	missense_variant		ENST00000263967.3		87
104	PIK3CA	5290	E545K	PIK3CA E545K/E542K are the second most recurrent PIK3CA mutations in breast cancer, and are highly recurrent mutations in many other cancer types. E545K, and possibly the other mutations in the E545 region, may present patients with a poorer prognosis than patients with either patients with other PIK3CA variant or wild-type PIK3CA. There is also data to suggest that E545/542 mutations may confer resistance to EGFR inhibitors like cetuximab.

Of PIK3CA mutant breast cancers, over half harbor this mutation. Meta-analyses have shown that patients harboring this mutation may have worse overall survival, but other studies have shown no difference between Exon 21 and other PIK3CA mutants from a prognostic standpoint. While very prevalent, targeted therapies for this particular mutation are still in early clinical trial phases.	37	variant	15	exon_variant		ENST00000263967.3		89

E545K, and possibly the other mutations in the E545 region, may present patients with a poorer prognosis than patients with either patients with other PIK3CA variant or wild-type PIK3CA. There is also data to suggest that exon 10 mutations may confer resistance to EGFR inhibitors like cetuximab.

107	PIK3CA	5290	H1047R	PIK3CA H1047R is one of the most recurrent single nucleotide variants in cancer, especially breast cancer. Of PIK3CA-mutant breast cancers, over half harbor this mutation. Meta-analyses have shown that patients harboring this mutation may have worse overall survival, but other studies have shown no difference between H1047R and other PIK3CA mutants from a prognostic standpoint. While very prevalent, targeted therapies for this particular mutation are still in early clinical trial phases.	37	variant	49	missense_variant		ENST00000263967.3		91
108	PML	5371	PML-RARA	The PML-RARA fusion is seen as a diagnostic event in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown sensitivity to ATRA in APL patients harboring the PML-RARa fusion. Recent interest has been shown in combining ATRA and arsenic trioxide for treating these patients, and early results seem promising.	39	variant	132.5	transcript_fusion		ENST00000268058.3	ENST00000254066.5	92
110	PTEN	5728	R233*	PTEN R233* has been shown to be a loss of function mutation, and PTEN loss has been the subject of considerable research in breast cancer. PTEN loss may sensitize cells to PI3K-mTOR inhibition. While still being debated, there is data to support that PTEN loss is both associated with poorer prognosis, and no change in prognosis.	41	variant	19	stop_gained	loss_of_function_variant	ENST00000371953.3		93
112	RET	5979	C634W	RET C634W has been implicated as an alternate mechanism of activating RET in medullary thyroid cancer. While there currently are no RET-specific inhibiting agents, promiscuous kinase inhibitors have seen some success in treating RET overactivity. Data suggests however, that the C634W mutation may lead to drug resistance, especially against the VEGFR-inhibitor motesanib.	42	variant	3	missense_variant		ENST00000355710.3		94
113	RET	5979	M918T	RET M819T is the most common somatically acquired mutation in medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). While there currently are no RET-specific inhibiting agents, promiscuous kinase inhibitors have seen some success in treating RET overactivity. Data suggests however, that the M918T mutation may lead to drug resistance, especially against the VEGFR-inhibitor motesanib. It has also been suggested that RET M819T leads to more aggressive MTC with a poorer prognosis.	42	variant	66	missense_variant		ENST00000355710.3		95
114	SF3B1	23451	K666N	SF3B1 K666N is a variant found in myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic leukemias, and more recently, breast cancer. This somatic mutation has been linked to better overall outcome and event-free survival in MDS patients.	44	variant	2	missense_variant		ENST00000335508.6		96
116	TP53	7157	R175H	While loss-of-function events in TP53 are very common in cancer, the R175H variant seems not only to result in loss of tumor-suppression, but also acts as a gain-of-function mutation that promotes tumorigenesis in mouse models. Cell lines harboring this mutant is also more responsive to treatment with doxorubicin than its wild-type counterparts. While the prognostic impact of individual TP53 mutations is influenced by the cohort being studied, it has been shown that the R175H mutation is correlated with worse overall survival than wild-type TP53, but is not as detrimental as the R248W variant.	45	variant	22	missense_variant		ENST00000269305.4		97
117	TP53	7157	R248Q	While loss-of-function events in TP53 are very common in cancer, the R248 variants seem not only to result in loss of tumor-suppression, but also act as a gain-of-function mutation that can promote tumorigenesis in mouse models. This mutant is also more responsive to treatment with doxorubicin than its wild-type counterparts. While the prognostic impact of individual TP53 mutations is influenced by the cohort being studied, R248 mutations have been shown to confer worse overall survival. The R248Q mutation has also shown an increased invasive behavior in cell lines. This is specific to the 248Q variant.	45	variant	34	missense_variant		ENST00000269305.4		98
118	TP53	7157	R248W	While loss-of-function events in TP53 are very common in cancer, the R248 variants seem not only to result in loss of tumor-suppression, but also act as a gain-of-function mutation that can promote tumorigenesis in mouse models. This mutant is also more responsive to treatment with doxorubicin than its wild-type counterparts. While the prognostic impact of individual TP53 mutations is influenced by the cohort being studied, R248 mutations have been shown to confer worse overall survival.	45	variant	19	missense_variant		ENST00000269305.4		99

Generally these mutations are loss-of-function which have been shown in mouse models to impair hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and cause aberrant hematopoiesis. These mutations have been found to be mutually exclusive with MLL and IDH1/2 mutations and have been associated with shortened event-free-survival and disease-free-survival when co-occurring with NPM1+/FLT3- genotypes. Overall Survival has been found to be shorter when occurring with NPM1+/FLT3+ genotypes.

Further characterization of this variant verified crizotinib resistance and additionally demonstrated resistance to multiple next generation ALK inhibitors including ceritinib, alectinib and brigatinib. Experiments using the HSP90 inhibitor  17-AAG have indicated potential sensitivity of EML4-ALK G1202R to this drug, suggesting this variant may be an HSP90 client protein.	1	variant	23.5	missense_variant	transcript_fusion	ENST00000389048.3		143

The mutation was absent in tumor sample taken before crizotinib treatment. Characterization of the variant using cell lines expressing EML4-ALK with 1151 T insert found the variant to be highly crizotinib resistant, and other work demonstrated resistance to next generation inhibitor alectinib, while resistance to tool compound TAE684 indicates potential resistance to the next generation ALK inhibitor ceritinib which is derived from TAE684. Other experiments suggest theraputic potential for HSP90 inhibitors, as EML4-ALK T1151 Tins sensitivity to 17-AAG has been observed.	1	variant	18	inframe_insertion	transcript_fusion	ENST00000389048.3		145

These mutations are associated with adverse prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly in the context of NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations, which often co-occur. Early results indicate AML patients with DNMT3A mutations may respond better to decitabine than those with wild-type. Shorter survival has been indicated in patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, however, larger cohorts are required to verify this finding. DNMT3A mutations have been suggested as a pre-leukemic lesion and found in older individuals with clonal hematopoiesis but no overt malignancy.	18	variant	115	transcript_variant		ENST00000264709.3		160

199	IDH2	3418	R172	IDH2 R172 is a gain-of-function mutation commonly observed in acute myeloid leukemia and is enriched in those patients which are cytogenetically normal. R172 is analogous to IDH1 R132 mutations and leads to neomorphic enzymatic activity. Specifically this mutation "catalyzes the conversion of alpha ketoglurarate to beta-hydrozyglutarate" leading to increased levels of beta-hydrozyglutarate. This in turn leads to hypermethylation of target genes and an inhibition of cellular differentiation. R172 mutations generally lead to worse overall survival and higher rates of relapse compared to the most common IDH2 mutations in AML (R140).	27	variant	105	protein_altering_variant		ENST00000330062.3		169
200	IKZF1	10320	DELETION	IKZF1 deletions have been reported in a variety of cancer types including pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP ALL), Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome, T-cell ALL as well as solid tumors of the large intestine, lung, and liver. The clinical impact of these deletions is unknown for many cancer types however a poor outcome has been observed in leukemia based disease. This gene has been strongly implicated as a regulator for "normal  hematopoiesis". In regards to BCP ALL, mouse models have shown that mutations in IKZF1 are not sufficient in and of themselves to cause disease.  Haploinsuffeciency in combination with BCR-ABL1 however, will accelerate leukemiagenesis possibly indicating that at least in regards to BCP ALL these are secondary events that may be necessary for the development of leukaemic clones.	73	variant	85	transcript_ablation		ENST00000331340.3		170

220	TERT	7015	PROMOTER MUTATION	TERT promoter mutations are activating and commonly found at two hotspots within the TERT promoter region which occur 124 and 146 base pairs (hg19) upstream of the translation start site. These hotspots, termed C228T and C250T are observed in many cancer types and have a particularly high prevalence in glioblastoma (83%), melanoma (71%), bladder cancer (66%) and hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC) (47%). The two mutations are usually heterozygous and mutually exclusive and result in an increased similarity to an ETS binding domain and may act as a binding site to an ETS transcription factor. These mutations are thought to be early events in tumorgenesis and aid in cellular immortality. Decreased overall survival in patients with these mutations have been observed in medulloblastoma, thyroid cancer, urogenital cancer, melanoma, and laryngeal tumors. The presence of these mutations has also been shown to be predictive of malignant/premalignant nodules in HCC and meningiomas.	79	variant	80	regulatory_region_variant		ENST00000310581.5		189

267	FGFR1	2260	AMPLIFICATION	FGFR1 amplifications are the most common aberrations of the FGFR family in cancer. One study reports FGFR1 aberrations in 3.5% of 4,853 patients of which most are FGFR1 amplifications (Helsten et. al., 2016). Preclinically, FGFR1 amplifications have also been shown to confer sensitivity to FGFR1 inhibitors (Weiss et. al., 2010). Clinical studies are currently ongoing (e.g. NCT01004224).	1885	variant	158	transcript_amplification		ENST00000425967.3		224
268	FGFR1	2260	EXPRESSION	FGFR1 high expression has been reported in 11.8% (178 patients) of oral squamous cell carcinoma patients, and was enriched in early stages (Freier et. al., 2007). Another study reports FGFR1 expression in 35% of primary HNSSC (353 patients) (Göke et. al., 2015). In both studies, FGFR1 gene amplification and expression do not correlate well with about 35% of samples with FGFR1 amplification overexpressing FGFR1 (Göke et. al., 2015). FGFR1 expression also correlated with sensitivity to FGFR1 inhibitors in preclinical models of lung cancer (Wynes et. al., 2014), HNSSC (Göke et. al., 2015) and urothelial carcinoma (Lamont et. al., 2011).	1885	variant	46			ENST00000425967.3		225
269	ROS1	6098	REARRANGEMENT	ROS1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that frequently forms gene fusions in several cancer types. Approximately 2% of NSCLC patients harbor a ROS1 gene fusion. Several fusion partners have been described with a constant ROS1-breakpoint, maintaining the kinase domain (Solomon B, 2015). Following case-studies and retrospective analyses, an expansion cohort of a phase-1 study showed clinical benefit of crizotinib in ROS1 rearranged NSCLC. The benefit was independent of the type of ROS1-rearrangement (Shaw et. al.,2014).	4941	variant	68	transcript_fusion		ENST00000368508.3		226

271	ATR	545	I774FS	Single A insertion or deletion in the 10 A mononucleotide run in exon 10 of ATR results in a frameshift of codon I774.

272	CDKN2A	1029	p16 EXPRESSION	CDKN2A (p16) expression is a surrogate marker of HPV infection in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. CDKN2A and p53 are inactivated through HPV proteins E6 and E7 and therefore not altered in expression level in HPV-associated carcinomas. However, there is no perfect overlap between p16 expression and HPV status with some 10-12.5% of HPV-negative tumors expressing p16. (Seiwert, T JCO, 2014). p16 positivity is a well-established positive prognostic factor in squamous cell cancer of the head and neck in the primary and, as increasing evidence suggests, recurrent/metastatic disease settings. Predictive information from HPV status have not been established to date. A lack of benefit from EGFR-inhibitors has been proposed by some studies. Other studies were not able to reproduce this finding.	14	variant	180			ENST00000498124.1		229

306	ERBB2	2064	AMPLIFICATION	Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered. Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.	20	variant	822.5	transcript_amplification		ENST00000269571.5		261

In breast cancer PIK3CA mutations have been associated with better prognosis, and a greater survival outcome, however the PI3K pathway is also associated with increased drug resistance (trastuzumab/lapatinib). PIK3CA mutations in both HNSCC and CRC have been associated with resistance to anti-EGFR therapeutic agents and mutations in exon 9 and 20 are associated with a poorer prognosis in CRC. Interestingly PIK3CA mutations in HNSCC have been observed to be absent from a number of ethnic groups including greek, german, and vietnamese populations.	37	variant	274	transcript_variant	gain_of_function_variant	ENST00000263967.3		266

414	ERBB2	2064	Y772_A775DUP	Mutations in the HER2 kinase domain occur at a 2-4% frequency in lung adenocarcinomas, the majority of which are in exon 20 as in-frame duplications or insertions in a small 8 codon region (774-781 or 775-782). These are analogous to the exon 20 alterations found in EGFR TK domain. The M774 insertion, M774insAYVM, represents 62.5% of all HER2 kinase domain mutations identified (when combined with the A775insYVMA mutations as they translate to the identical amino acid sequence changes). As demonstrated in mouse models (Perrera et al., PNAS 2009) and subsequent clinical trials in human lung adenocarcinoma with these insertions, HER2 YVMA mutants predict response to several targeted HER2 agonists such as afatinib, trastuzumab, neratinib and TDM-1 (trastuzumab emtansine) as monotherapy or combined with specific chemotherapies.	20	variant	36	inframe_insertion		ENST00000269571.5		368

420	IDH1	3417	R132H	IDH1 R132 mutations have been observed in a number of cancer types, and appear to behave quite differently in different environments. In myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IDH1 R132 mutations have been shown to be associated with worse outcome and shorter overall survival. They have also been linked to cytogenetically normal AML, an intermediate risk subtype of the disease. However, in glioblastoma and astrocytoma, patients with IDH1 mutations have shown better overall survival than patients with wild-type IDH1. Also in contrast to AML, in glioblastoma, IDH1 mutations have been associated with the specific cytogenetic abnormalities, 1p and 19q deletions.	26	variant	9	missense_variant		ENST00000415913.1		373

This fusion is typically associated with favorable prognosis relative to other AML subtypes (including cytogenetically normal); however, the impact of additional mutations in the context of this fusion is incompletely understood. AMLs with this fusion are often grouped with other rearrangements affecting genes encoding core binding factor subunits, referred to as CBF AMLs.	776	variant	20	transcript_fusion		ENST00000412916.2	ENST00000396324.3	383

497	ERBB2	2064	S310F/Y	ERBB2 S310F/Y was one of the first ERBB2 variants to be functionally classified (Greulich et al. 2012). This mutation was shown to be an activating mutation (through hyperphosphorylation) in an in vitro assay. In the same paper, this mutation (along with other ERBB2 activating mutations) in murine Ba/F3 cells have been shown to be sensitive to the ERBB2 inhibitors (afatinib, lapatinib and neratinib). More recent evidence may show that HER2 acitivating mutations confer sensitivity to a host of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which is the topic of current clinical trials and research.	20	variant	4	missense_variant		ENST00000269571.5		444

499	ALK	238	ALK FUSIONS	Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. 

In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. 

Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets.  ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.   

ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC.  Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.	1	variant	470.5	transcript_fusion		ENST00000389048.3		446
500	ALK	238	EML4-ALK E20;A20	EML4-ALK variant 2 consists of a fusion of the ALK kinase domain (exons 20-29) with EML4 exons 1-20. Variant 2 has cytoplasmic distribution and makes up ~10% of EML4-ALK fusions found in NSCLC,. Although the specific variant is not consistently reported, single cases demonstrating response to crizotinib treatment in NSCLC and a differentiated malignant neoplasm of unknown origin have been reported. In vitro, this variant has shown greater sensitivity to ALK inhibition with TAE684 and crizotinib than the EML4-ALK variants 1 (E13;A20), 3a (E6;A20) and 3b (E6ins33;A20). The variant was reported to be less stable in cells than other variants, and may be a client protein of Hsp90. Along these lines the variant has shown preclinical sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibition.	1	variant	16.5	transcript_fusion		ENST00000318522.5	ENST00000389048.3	447

503	ALK	238	EML4-ALK E6;A20	The EML4-ALK variant 3a consists of the ALK kinase domain fused to EML4 exons 1-6, while the 3b variant has an additional 33bp of intronic EML4 sequence between EML4 and ALK regions. The two variants were found to originate from a single genomic rearrangement, and 3a/3b is found in ~ 30% of EML4-ALK positive NSCLC. Variant 3a has cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution. In vitro, these variants have shown sensitivity to ALK inhibitors TAE684 and crizotinib but less sensitive than other EML4-ALK variants. The H2228 cell line contains 3a and 3b variants and is described as having cyctostatic response to ALK inhibition as opposed to apoptotic. In a study of 31 NSCLC patients with EML4-ALK rearrangements, 4/5 patients with the 3a variant showed a partial response while 1 showed progressive disease (the only PD observed). In cells the 3a variant was reported to be more stable than other variants, less sensitive to crizotinib and not to respond to Hsp90 inhibition.	1	variant	25	transcript_fusion		ENST00000318522.5	ENST00000389048.3	450

However, acquired resistance to imatinib is common. Patients harboring exon 9 KIT mutations may benefit from higher imatinib doses (800mg/daily). Similarly, imatinib-refractory tumors showed sensitivity to sunitinib treatment. Improved responses to either treatment were not observed in patients with exon 11 mutations.	29	variant	50	exon_variant		ENST00000288135.5		456

This mutation has not been reportedly observed in a patient but inferred as a variant likely to emerge in crizotinib-resistant tumors. In vitro kinase activity, structural predictions and growth inhibition assays indicate the L2026M mutation in the CD74-ROS1 fusion provides crizotinib resistance. Additional preclinical assays have indicated that crizotinib resistant cells harboring this mutation are sensitive to PF-06463922 and foretinib.	4941	variant	9	missense_variant	transcript_fusion	ENST00000368508.3		463

ALK-rearranged DLBCL is less responsive to CHOP chemotherapy. Preclinical work indicates that CLTC-ALK DLBCL is responsive to ALK inhibition in cell lines and mouse models, and two case studies show short response followed by progression when heavily pretreated and advanced ALK-positive DLBCL is treated with crizotinib (one case CLTC-ALK, one case an unknown ALK fusion).	1	variant	19	transcript_fusion		ENST00000269122.3	ENST00000389048.3	467

527	ALK	238	ALK FUSION I1171	Multiple case reports indicate that the I1171T missense mutation in ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) confers resistance to crizotinib and alectinib but is sensitive to ceritinib treatment. These results have been validated in vitro. In vitro evidence indicates this mutation interferes with alectinib binding the active site of ALK and may explain the sensitivity to the structurally distinct ALK inhibitor ceritinib.	1	variant	42.5	missense_variant	transcript_fusion	ENST00000389048.3		473
528	ALK	238	EML4-ALK  V1180L	The V1180L missense mutation was identified in a mutagenesis screen to find mutations that conferred resistance to alectinib in a non-small cell lung cancer cell line. This mutation shows resistance to crizotinib and alectinib but sensitivity to TAE684, ceritinib and more mild sensitivity to brigatinib. Similar to I1171T, it resides in the ATP pocket of ALK and likely interferes with alectinib and crizotinib binding as a mechanism of resistance.	1	variant	13	missense_variant	transcript_fusion	ENST00000389048.3		474

551	ALK	238	ALK FUSION F1245C	In neuroblastoma, F1245 is one of three hotspot ALK mutations found at a high frequency. In a case study, a pretreated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient with EML4-ALK F1245C mutation responded well to ceritinib after slow disease progression during crizotinib treatment. Crizotinib resistance was attributed to the F1245C mutation, although the ALK-rearrangement was not sequenced prior to crizotinib treatment. The patient's slow onset of disease progression during crizotinib treatment mirrors preclinical findings that indicate ALK-fusion with F1245C has moderate resistance to crizotinib compared to the fusion alone.	1	variant	14.5	missense_variant	transcript_fusion	ENST00000389048.3		497

780	GLI1	2735	ACTB-GLI1	Fusion of the hedgehog pathway component gene GLI1 to the β-actin gene (ACTB)  has been described as a mechanism of GLI1,and by extension hedgehog pathway, activation. These fusions have been described in histologically distinctive soft tissue tumours showing a pericytic phenotype.  Gene fusions retain the DNA-binding zinc finger domains of GLI1 and it is likely that the replacement of the promoter region of GLI1with that of the ubiquitously expressed ACTB gene leads to deregulation of GLI expression and its downstream target genes.	2279	variant	15	gene_fusion				703

It has been widely reported in both familial and sporadic cases of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 with medullary thyroid cancers. Despite extensive WGS and Exome coverage for a combined total of ~150k alleles in the GNOMAD browser, this variant has never been observed.	42	variant	20	missense_variant		ENST00000355710.3		996

1300	TP53	7157	CONSERVED DOMAIN MUT	This conserved domain mutation variant covers mutations in regions of p53 reported to be highly conserved during evolution. These regions span codons 117-143 (region II), 171-181 (region III), 234-258 (region (IV), and 270-286 (region V). Region I covers approximately codons 10 through 25 but does not appear in all studies on conserved domain mutations. There is overlap with these regions and reported regions of hotspot p53 mutations, where it is observed that hotspots for detrimental mutation correspond to more highly evolutionary conserved regions. While there is agreement and overlap between different reports, the literature does not seem to indicate an exact consensus on these regions of human p53 at this time, but the four highly conserved regions are part of the DNA binding domain, and are reported to exist within codons 97 to 292.	45	variant	15			ENST00000269305.4		1035

1739	VHL	7428	R167Q (c.500G>A)	R167Q is the most common point mutation in hereditary Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease and disrupts the VHL genes binding to elongin C reducing the levels of the VHL-elongin B-elongin C (VBC) E3 ligase complex and inhibiting the ability of VHL to regulate HIF2α. This partial function in turn leads to an increased risk of tumorgenesis. VHL derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma models however have shown the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib can act to stabilize mutant VHL-R167Q leading to downregulation of HIF2α and suprressed tumorgenesis.	58	variant	75	missense_variant		ENST00000256474.2		1286

1956	VHL	7428	E70K (c.208G>A)	The VHL gene has a low rate of benign missense variation and is known to be definitively associated with VHL disease. The E70K missense mutation, located in the Beta-domain of VHL, is rare in open-source genome databases (0.00001489 allele frequency in ExAC, 4.365e-6 allele frequency in gnomAD) and was identified in several individuals with VHL disease symptoms (see evidence statements). Thus, this variant could be assigned ACMG code 'PP2' - Missense mutation in a gene with a low rate of benign missense variation where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease. Although this variant is registered once in ExAC and gnomAD, 'PM2' could be applied (Absent from controls in ESP, 1000 Genomes or ExAc) because VHL manifestations sometimes emerge later in adulthood. Thus, the allele may have been detected in a proband who was not yet affected by symptoms.	58	variant	37.5	missense_variant		ENST		1491
